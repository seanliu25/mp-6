I have tried my best. The current implementation only works for login, and after login, the user's information is stored in MongoDB. However, I was trying to figure out how to retrieve the data from MongoDB for the profile page using authentication, but it didnâ€™t work successfully. :(

You can directly test it in the local environment.
